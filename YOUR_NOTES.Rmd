# R notebooks

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook.
When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor.
Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks.
Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

You can also view your notebook in a 'What you see is what you get (WYSIWYG)' editing mode called 'visual' mode to have an experience more like a word processor and use tools like reference management.
